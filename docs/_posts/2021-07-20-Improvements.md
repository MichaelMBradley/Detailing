The last few weeks have been fairly devoid of massive new additions as I've been attempting to bugfix my code.

While not yet perfect, I have now gotten to a stage that I am fairly happy with. Of course, it isn't difficult to spot mistakes, but the vast majority of the curves have generated properly.

Here's another close-up of a section of the polycurve.

Below are some full polycurves.

While quashing the last few bugs, I'll also be focused on more artistic ideals, trying to find ways to alter the look and feel of the polycurve.
