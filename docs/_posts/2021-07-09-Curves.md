title: Curves

I haven't made a post yet this week as I've been hoping to present a working program, but unfortunately I haven't yet been able to remove all the bugs.

In terms of bugs left to squash, I only have to worry about arcs crossing over each other, as in the final version I want one seemingly continuous curve that never intersects itself.

 Most (~80%) of the curves work exactly as I want, but the ones that don't stand out. The ones that don't are a combination of connecting arcs that don't take a direct enough route between existing circles, and the curves in between trees of arcs.

For connecting the trees, I've decided to use BÃ©zier curves. By carefully selecting the control points, I can place the curves so that the last arc on one tree and the first arc on the next are connected in a manner that appears smooth. I tried implementing clothoids, but I had some issues placing them exactly where I needed them, and they took too meandering a path anyway.

With any luck, in the next post I can post an image of the entire curve looking good.
