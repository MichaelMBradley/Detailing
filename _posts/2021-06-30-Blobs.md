title: Blobs
---

I've recently made some more progress on smoothing the exteriors of groups of nodes. My goal is to have the curve follow the nodes fairly roughly and minimise the length of curve touching a node. I want to create fairly blobby shapes, but I still want them to have detail.

What I've done here is to detect when two consecutive "smoothing circles" (circular bases for the arcs that connect the nodes) are overlapping, and replace them with one circle that is touching all three relevant nodes. While this introduced its own host of bugs, it has allowed me to cherry-pick some sections and show them here, as they are getting close to the product I'm envisioning.

My next goals are to continue to iron out the bugs and create a consistent way of swapping between trees/groups of nodes (including the last and first nodes).

I have also considered using the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of each group as the basis for a curve, but I don't think it would offer enough complexity. The [relative convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_convex_hull) and the [orthogonal convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_convex_hull) seemed to be promising ideas, but I can't find any pre-existing code that can calculate them for me.
