title: Packing
---

Now that I had some structure, I could get to work. I began by trying to affix some circles to othe edges of my basic square shape.

I was able to make quick progress towards edges being covered by circles of a uniform size.

But as I tried rotating the shape I realised that my code still had issues.

{: style="text-align:center"}

While this type of packing could still yield results, there was another method that I wanted to try as well.

I experimented with packing just a square full of circles, each assigned randomly.

{: style="text-align:center"}

While this method generally leaves gaps between the circles, I simply calculated the distance from the circle to it's closest neighbour and increased it's radius accordingly, giving the above image.

Next, I overlayed a shape I had onto the random packing and wrote code to remove any circles that were not near one of it's edges, leaving me with the following:

{: style="text-align:center"}
![A strange polygon with many circles of varying sizes overlapping its edges.](_assets/05-04/RandomEdgePacking.png)

I believe that this is a promising avenue, and tomorrow I will look towards inducing a graph between the remaining circles, and either altering existing circles or creating new ones to fill in any remaining gaps between adjacent groups.
