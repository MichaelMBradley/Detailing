After a break, I made some good progress today.

In the image below, I have combined a few improvements. First, I finally tracked down some bugs that were causing trees to generate in incorrect places, so now everything works as it should. As well, I implemented a check to remove instances of one-node trees. Most importantly, I assigned a weight to every base node. When deciding which tree to add a new node to, my old method only considered the distance between the new node and any potential base nodes. By multiplying the distance by a random weight, I can vary the size of the trees to prevent uniformity.

On another note, I also downloaded the latest Alpha version of Processing 4 to try out. While it is not bug free, it is fairly stable and uses a more recent version of Java, which could be useful. As well, a few weeks ago I implemented a grid as a bug fixing tool. Today, I took some time to implement a zoom feature along with it, as I was making some other structural changes to how I drew the images as well. While I did not previously mention these tools, hopefully I can use the zoom functionality to better draw attention to certain portions of an image in the future.

Tomorrow, along with continuing to work on improving my connecting arc method of smoothing, I will work on a way to create more space in between trees for clarity.
